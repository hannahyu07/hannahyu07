### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi there, my name is Hannah Yu. Iâ€™m a third-year undergrad student at the University of Toronto. Pursuing a double major in economics and statistics with a focus on data analysis has provided me with invaluable opportunities to delve into the intersection of these fields. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, Iâ€™ve developed a proficient command of several statistical software tools, including R, Stata, Python, and SQL.
